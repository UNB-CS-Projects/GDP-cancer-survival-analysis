        "Initially, we hypothesized that a countries GDP per capita strongly correlates with the survival rate of late-stage cancer, because wealthier countries are better equipped to provide advanced medical care. However, as we began collecting data, we found that reliable statistics specifically on late-stage cancer survival were difficult to obtain, making it challenging to test our hypothesis effectively. Given these limitations, we decided to broaden our focus to overall cancer survival rates rather than just late-stage cases. While this adjustment changes the specificity of our hypothesis, the core idea remains the same: higher economic resources may contribute to better cancer treatment and improved patient outcomes.\n",
