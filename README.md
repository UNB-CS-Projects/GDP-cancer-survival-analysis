## Hypothesis
**Brief Background**: 
GDP per capita could explain how well a country is equipped to provide advanced medical care for late-stage cancer patients, including access to cutting-edge treatments, specialized healthcare facilities, and early interventions.

**Statement**: 
The survival rate of late-stage cancer has a strong correlation with GDP per capita, suggesting that higher economic resources may contribute to better cancer treatment and improved patient outcomes.

**Plan for testing Hypothesis**: 
Collect Data – Gather late-stage cancer survival rates (GCO, CONCORD) and GDP per capita (World Bank).
Merge & Clean Data – Standardize country names and handle missing values.
Analyze Correlation – Use Pearson correlation and linear regression to test the relationship.
Visualize Results – Create scatter plots and statistical summaries.
Interpret Findings – Assess significance (p < 0.05) and consider confounding factors.
